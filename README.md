# Ohio-State-Open-Source-Intelligence
A project to automate the open source intelligence gathering step in risk assessment of third party vendors. The project requests the company name and website in to assess the security level of their digital infrastructure and any incidents related to IT. It generates an incomplete report from various websites using webscraping techniques. 

One notable thing about this project is the use of proxies to utilize a www.whois.com service that is limited to 10 use per IP. This technique can be applied to other fields to circumvent a service use limit. You may be violating a vendors terms and services agreement that may result in a civil lawsuit if they can detect this bypass. Therefore, please do your due diligence before taking any action.
## Make file will be added soon
